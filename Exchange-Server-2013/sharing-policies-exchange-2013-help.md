# Directivas de uso compartido

 

_**Se aplica a:** Exchange Server 2013_

A part of federated sharing, sharing policies enable user-established, people-to-people sharing of calendar information with different types of external users. Sharing polices are assigned to user mailboxes and allow your users to self-manage and share their free/busy information (including the Calendar folder) with recipients in external Office 365 organizations or other federated Exchange on-premises organizations. If you want to share calendars with recipients that aren't in one of these types of organizations, sharing policies allow people-to-people sharing of calendar information with any email recipient through the use of Internet Calendar Publishing.

The following topics will help you configure and manage sharing policies as a part of federated sharing for your organization:
